/**
 * The document registry represents a store of SourceFile objects that can be shared between
 * multiple LanguageService instances. A LanguageService instance holds on the SourceFile (AST)
 * of files in the context.
 * SourceFile objects account for most of the memory usage by the language service. Sharing
 * the same DocumentRegistry instance between different instances of LanguageService allow
 * for more efficient memory utilization since all projects will share at least the library
 * file (lib.d.ts).
 *
 * A more advanced use of the document registry is to serialize sourceFile objects to disk
 * and re-hydrate them when needed.
 *
 * To create a default DocumentRegistry, use createDocumentRegistry to create one, and pass it
 * to all subsequent createLanguageService calls.
